# Future Updates

## Bugs


## Improvements

- [ ] I want the stories to have a bit less fluff, they should still be presented in an interesting way, but don't add unessisary comments
- [ ] Each story should have at least one link to an article that backs the claims that are being made.
- [ ] Instead of providing the dropdown with a transcipt of the whole podcast, break it up into multiple downpdowns - one for each story, and then in the dropdown also include the links that support the artile
- [ ] Ensure that nothing being said is made up. It should all be backed by a relable source
- [ ] The into clip and outro clip can be trimmed down a lot
